A microphone preamp is required to match the output of a typical Electret
microphone to the Arduino's ADC.  A simple preamp is shown in preamp_circuit.png.
This preamp is minimal and is not low noise.

You should read http://www.hobby-hour.com/electronics/computer_microphone.php
before wiring the jack for your microphone.  I have included a copy as 
ComputerMicrophones.pdf.  I have ordered a Olympus ME-15 Microphone.  This
microphone has a 3.5mm mono plug so both bias and signal are on the tip.
Many recorder microphones have 2.5mm plugs.

Also look at http://www.shure.com/ProAudio/Products/us_pro_ea_connectingmics
before buying a professional microphone.

The output from the preamp must be 0 - 5 volts with silence producing 2.5 volts. 

I used half of a TLV2372IP since it is a rail-to-rail op amp that works with the
Arduino's 5 volt supply.  I suspect there are better choices but I had this part.
I requested samples of LMV722 op-amps but they are SOIC, not DIP.

preamp_close.jpg and preamp_shield.jpg show a version of this circuit where
R3 and R4 are 12k and the gain pot, R5, is replaced by a fixed 470k resistor.

The photos are before I added C2 to reduce high frequency noise which also reduces
high frequency response.  You may want to adjust the value of C2. See 
preamp_response.png for the response curves with the preamp connected to the 
Arduino's ADC.

I used cheap 1% resistors from eBay's "Asia Engineer store".  The color codes 
are not very clear in the photos.

The circuit was built on a small prototype board from 
http://www.wrighthobbies.net/.  I used 1/4 of a SEPB576 board.

The board plugs into the Arduino analog and power headers.

I use a Plantronics .Audio 355 headset with this preamp for debug.

This data sheet has an example of a better preamp with speech bandpass filters.

See FIGURE 7 - Speech Bandpass Filtered Data Acquisition System.

TI sent me five samples each of OPA2344PA and LMV722IDR at no charge. 
Digikey sends them for TI.
