New Stuff
---------

Banks / Files
-------------

At the moment its 16 banks of 48 files because of memory limitations. Optimising will increase this at some point.

Pitch Control
-------------

add 'pitchMode=1' to the config.

In pitchMode any retrigger (either button or RESET input) will play the file from the start.

Wav Files 
---------

There is a new setting 'anyAudioFiles=1' which will read pretty much any 16 and 24 bit files.

BUT this will turn off crossfading so any channel changes are hard cuts.

If the setting is not in the file or is 0 then it will read .raw files and only those .wav files 
that are 44k 16bit mono.

Tip Top Format
--------------

If it finds 'config.txt' in the root of the card then it will scan for all
extensionless files in the root and assume they are 24/96 tip top format files.

It will only scan 128 of the files because of our bank / file limit.
